🚀 Just built something special — an Agentic Post Generator that uses a supervisor agent to coordinate two sub-agents:
🧠 Researcher → finds deep insights
✍️ Copywriter → crafts engaging posts
Together, they write detailed LinkedIn + X posts — autonomously.

What’s unique?
Instead of a single LLM trying to “do it all,” my system delegates tasks like humans do.
The Supervisor Agent decides who does what and when to refine.
This makes the output more consistent, context-aware, and human-like.

Under the hood:
⚙️ Built with LangChain + LangGraph
🤝 Uses handoff architecture for multi-agent workflows
📚 Integrates with RAG pipelines for fact-checked content
💬 Can post on LinkedIn and X directly

I’m experimenting with expanding it — adding analytics and sentiment-tuning so it can learn your posting style.
This is just the start of what agentic AI can do.
Would love feedback or collab ideas! 👇
